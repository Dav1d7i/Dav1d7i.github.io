 Bale, Benzema & Cristiano were a dominant trio that scared everyone in Europe. From the moment they played their first game everyone knew this trio was nothing to play with. It was the perfect mix. With Bale & Ronaldo on the wide areas creating with their trickery & pace and their long distance shooting, along with Benzema in the middle linking the play all together with his dynamic playstyle & quick passing brought all three players into the attack at all times. You can't forget about how clinical they are when it comes to scoring goals! A Deadly Trio.</p>

But they couldn't have won all these trophies without the help of their brilliant team. From the base of the defense and the core of the midfield the whole team contributed a whole lot, and made their footballing system work. BEST TRIO EVER!
